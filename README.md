# The Swipe for Solace: How Social Support and Emotional Needs Shape Dating App Use

This study explores whether **dating apps function as a strategy to compensate for deficits in emotional support and intimacy** in contemporary society.  
We analyze how individuals’ levels of social support shape their **dating-app usage and experiences** using a **mixed-methods approach**:

- **Quantitative survey:** Lower perceived social support was associated with higher likelihood of dating-app use.
- **Qualitative interviews:** Revealed that dating apps often served as temporary emotional outlets in the absence of sufficient offline support; however, some users experienced disappointment, heightened feelings of isolation, or repeated use linked to emotional vulnerability.
- **Key finding:** Positive perceptions of dating apps were significantly associated with **lower levels of loneliness** among users.

> These results suggest that dating-app usage is not merely a matter of personal preference or curiosity, but often a **strategic response to unmet social needs**, offering new sociological perspectives on **digital intimacy and social belonging**.
